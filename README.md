# Crap-OS
A rudimentary Computercraft OS, based entirely on a selection menu I found the day of starting to make this. It comes with things like Lyqyd's Packman, his Net Shell, NSH, and all of the extras, a login system from the CC forusm, a terminal-mirroring-to-monitor program, Simplechat, a simple rednet chat program also from the CC forums, and CraftEngine, an email client, again from the forums.
